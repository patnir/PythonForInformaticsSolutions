#Why should you learn to write programs?
#
#Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative 
#
#and rewarding activity.  You can write programs for 
#many reasons, ranging from making your living to solving
#a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping
#someone else solve a problem.  This book assumes that 
#everyone needs to know how to program, and that once 
#you know how to program you will figure out what you want 
#to do with your newfound skills.
